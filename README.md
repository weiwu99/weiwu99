# Hi this is Wei! 
I am currently an undergraduate student studying ECE/CS and my academic interest lies in signal processing and machine learning applications on various fields. In particular, I am very excited about the great potential of machine learning applications on biomedical industries! 

This account mainly serves as a portfolio where I can showcase some of the projects I have worked on. Feel free if you have any questions!
